# Data Collection
In this folder we keep all scripts and functions related to getting the information about the public transport into our database. 

## Strategy
Ideally we listen to an event stream over a TCP socket updating our database live as the information comes in. The files in CLIENT_SERVER are then concerned with getting that data from the database back to the client. 

## Implementation
